= Characterization

Careful characterization of classes is a key activity when doing Domain-Driven Design.
Fortunately, most of the time, it is fairly obvious what category a particular class belongs to.
Other times, it is not as easy to sort out, and careful analysis, team collaboration,
and refactoring are necessary.

The trickiest ones to classify are typically Entities, Aggregates, Value 
Objects and Domain Events. When possible, you should favor Value Objects over 
Entities or Domain Events, because they require less attention during 
implementation. Value Objects can be created and thrown away at will, and 
since they are immutable we can pass them around as we wish. We must be much 
less cavalier with Entities as identity and life-cycle have to be carefully 
managed.

Below is a short walk-through of key classes in the application and the 
motivation behind their implementation choice.
