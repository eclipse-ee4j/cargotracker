== Running the Application

The project is Maven based, so you should be able to easily build it or set it 
up in your favorite IDE. We currently have 
xref:vscode:main/main.adoc[instructions for Visual Studio Code].

You can also run the application directly from the command line using the 
https://codehaus-cargo.github.io/cargo/Maven2+plugin.html[Cargo Maven plugin]. 
All you need to do is navigate to the project source root and type the 
following (please make sure you have Java SE 11/Java SE 17 and JAVA_HOME set 
correctly):

`mvn clean package cargo:run`

Once the application starts up, just open up a browser and navigate to 
http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/.

This will run the application with Payara Server by default. The project also 
has Maven profiles to support GlassFish and Open Liberty. 
For example you can run using GlassFish using the following command:

`mvn clean package -Pglassfish cargo:run`

Similarly, you can run using Open Liberty using the following command:

`mvn clean package -Popenliberty liberty:run`
