<p>This is the application layer: code that's needed for the
    application to performs its tasks. It defines, or is defined by, use
    cases.</p>
<p>It is thin in terms of knowledge of domain business logic,
    although it may be large in terms of lines of code. It coordinates the
    domain layer objects to perform the actual tasks.</p>
<p>This layer is suitable for spanning transactions, security
    checks and high-level logging.</p>
