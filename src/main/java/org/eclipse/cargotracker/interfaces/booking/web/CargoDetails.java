/**
 * Handles viewing cargo details. Operates against a dedicated service facade, and could easily be
 * rewritten as a thick Swing client. Completely separated from the domain layer, unlike the
 * tracking user interface.
 *
 * <p>In order to successfully keep the domain model shielded from user interface considerations,
 * this approach is generally preferred to the one taken in the tracking controller. However, there
 * is never any one perfect solution for all situations, so we've chosen to demonstrate two
 * polarized ways to build user interfaces.
