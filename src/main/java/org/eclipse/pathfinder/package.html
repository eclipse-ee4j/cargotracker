<p>This is the path-finder application context, which is separate
    from "our" application and context. Our domain model with cargo,
    itinerary, handling event etc does not exist here. The routing domain
    service implementation works against the API exposed by this context.
</p>
<p>It is not related to the core application at all, and is only
    part of this source tree for developer convenience.</p>
