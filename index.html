            This project demonstrates how you can develop applications with the
            Jakarta EE platform using widely adopted architectural best
            practices like Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The code is intended to
            mirror a non-trivial application that developers in the real work
            would work on. It attempts to demonstrate first-hand how you can use
            Jakarta EE to effectively meet practical enterprise concerns such as
            productivity, agility, testability, flexibility, maintainability,
            scalability and security.<br>
            <br> The project is directly based on the well known original <a
              target="_blank" href="https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core">Java
              DDD sample</a> application developed by DDD pioneer Eric Evans'
            company <a target="_blank" href="http://domainlanguage.com/">Domain
              Language</a> and the Swedish software consulting company <a
              target="_blank" href="http://www.citerus.se/">Citerus</a>. The
            cargo example actually comes from Eric Evans' <a target="_blank"
              href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">seminal
              book</a>. That project used older versions of Spring, Hibernate and
            Jetty whereas we focus on vanilla Jakarta EE.<br>
            <br> In the same vein as that project, we certainly are not in
            the business of prescribing how you should write Jakarta EE
            applications. The code simply demonstrates ideas that you could
            adopt if you think they are right for you. We have also tried to
            show you just some of the many different approaches that you could
            take to interpret and implement DDD concepts. You are of course
            warmly welcomed to provide feedback and contribute to this Open
            Source project.<br>
            <br> As such, we will continue to rely heavily on the original
            DDD sample application as well as the existing knowledge base in the
            DDD community as invaluable resources on further details on DDD as
            it applies to this code base (please see the <a target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/citerus/dddsample-core">DDD Sample pages</a> for
            vital details). We also highly recommend you read the <a
              target="_blank" href="#eeddd">Jakarta EE and DDD</a> section. It
            is perhaps best to skim it, explore the application/code and revisit
            the section.<br>
            <br> This effort is very grateful for the kind blessings and
            guidance of the good folks behind the original DDD sample
            application.

            Before exploring the code, it may be helpful to view a demo of the
            application functionality. You can do that through the <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/cargotracker-documentation/current/gettingstarted/main/main.html">video
              on the Getting Started section of the documentation</a> that covers
            most of the major functionality for Eclipse Cargo Tracker. <br />
            <br /> If you simply wish to explore the code, <a target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/archive/master.zip">download
              it as a zip</a> or browse the <a target="_blank"
              href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/">GitHub
              repository</a>. <br />
            <br /> The source is a Maven project, so you should be able to
            easily build it or set it up in your favorite IDE. We currently have
            instructions for <a
              href="https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/cargotracker-documentation/current/vscode/main/main.html"
              target="_blank">Visual Studio Code as part of our documentation</a>.
            We welcome contributions showing how to use the project with other
            IDEs.<br>
            <br> You can also run the application directly from the Maven
            command line using Apache Cargo. All you need to do is navigate to
            the project source root and type the following (please make sure you
            have Java SE 11/Java SE 17 and JAVA_HOME set up):<br />
            <br />
            <code>mvn clean package cargo:run</code>
            <br />
            <br/> Once the application starts up, just open up a browser and
            navigate to <a target="_blank"
              href="http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/">http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/</a>.<br/>
            <br/> This will run the application with Payara Server by default. The project also has Maven profiles to support GlassFish
	    and Open Liberty. For example you can run using GlassFish using the following command:<br/>
            <br/>
            <code>mvn clean package -Pglassfish cargo:run</code>
            <br/>
            <br/> Similarly you can run using Open Liberty using the following command:<br/>
            <br/>
            <code>mvn clean package -Popenliberty liberty:run</code>
            <br/>
	    <br/> The project currently runs on Jakarta EE 10, Payara/GlassFish/Open Liberty, and Java
            SE 11/Java SE 17. We welcome contributions for running the
            application on other Jakarta EE implementations (as you will see in
            the source code, there are few dependencies on Payara/GlassFish/Open Liberty so this should
            be pretty easy to do).<br/>
            <br /> Eclipse Cargo Tracker is deployed to Kubernetes on the cloud
            using GitHub Actions workflows. You can find the demo deployment on
            the Scaleforce cloud (<a target="_blank"

          <p class="lead">Many of you might have at least heard of the J2EE
            Blue Prints/PetStore. In many ways, the J2EE Blue Prints/PetStore
            was far ahead of it's time. It helped establish some degree of order
            out of the chaos of mid-nineties enterprise development. It brought
            to the mainstream many architectural patterns like separation of
            concerns, layering, MVC, DAO, DTO and the like that we now mostly
            take for granted. It also helped catapult J2EE itself. The PetStore
            of course was not without its own fair share of problems. The most
            significant of these problems is the fact that many patterns in the
            PetStore were either motivated or encumbered by the problems of the
            then relatively new J2EE and EJB 2 technologies and EJB 2 entity
            beans did not support OO well.</p>

          <center>
            <img src="img/cargotracker-influences.png" />
          </center>

          <p class="lead">DDD provided concrete solutions to the weaknesses
            in the PetStore with the help of emergent concepts of POJO
            programming, ORM and lightweight frameworks. It is no accident that
            DDD is now widely adopted by the Spring and .NET communities. As
            Jakarta EE has now fully embraced concepts like POJO programming,
            lightweight programming models, annotations, ORM, rich domain
            models, agility and testability, this project brings things full
            circle. It demonstrates first hand how you can utilize the best of
            the breed in enterprise software development practices using the
            power and simplicity of the standard, vendor-neutral Jakartra EE
            platform. Notably unlike the J2EE Blue Prints/PetStore, we will not
            invent new patterns here but simply adopt the proven, mature ideas
            in the DDD community.</p>

            The basic building blocks of the domain are entities, value objects,

            section of our documentation overviews how these concepts are
            implemented in the application using Jakarta EE. Logical layers
            partitioning distinct concerns are super-imposed on the core concept
            of the domain. These layers generally consist of the UI/interface
            layer, the application layer, the domain layer (of course!) and the
            infrastructure layer respectively. The <a target="_blank"
              href="https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/cargotracker-documentation/current/layers/main/main.html">Layers</a>
            section of our documentation explains the architectural layers in
            the application and how they relate to various Jakarta EE APIs. The
            DDD community also fully embraces practices like automated testing,
            agile, emergent design, refactoring and Continuous Integration. We
            have incorporated all these practices into the application in a
            pragmatic fashion. DDD is a very useful concept in pragmatic
            microservices development, particularly ideas such as the bounded
            context. We have incorporated some of these ideas. Some DDD related
            concepts we have not tackled are CQRS and Event Sourcing.

          <p class="lead">
            One of the primary principles of DDD is that design should be
            focused on the business domain, not technology. The role of
            technology is to empower software developers to implement readable,
            productive, maintainable systems that mirror the real world, not
            place constraints on design choices. Most mainstream technology
            stacks today have matured enough to make this principle a reality,
            Jakarta EE is no exception. In fact, with a single-minded focus on
            simplicity, POJOs, Java/OO centric strong typing, annotations and
            intelligent defaults that minimize system configuration and lets
            developers focus on solving the business problem, we think Jakarta
            EE is one of the best platforms to support DDD. Jakarta EE makes it
            possible to quickly and effectively produce a working system by
            annotating domain and application classes and implementing interface
            and infrastructure code. In the <a target="_blank"
              href="https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/cargotracker-documentation/current/characterization/main/main.html">Characterization</a>
            and <a target="_blank"
              href="https://jakarta.ee/learn/docs/cargotracker-documentation/current/layers/main/main.html">Layers</a>
            sections of our documentation we have overviewed how some key
            Jakarta EE APIs map to DDD concepts and pointed you to some of the
            most important bits of implementation code in the application. In
            the figure below, we have summarized how this mapping looks like
            visually as a handy cross reference.

          <p class="lead">Note, the diagram above is most certainly not
            intended to be comprehensive. For example, besides Jakarta Faces,
            REST, WebSocket and Batch, some other technologies that are very
            useful in implementing interfaces are CDI (for Faces backing beans),
            Bean Validation, Enterprise Beans (e.g. messaging end-points), JSON
            Processing and JSON Binding. Similarly, you can choose to implement
            application services as transactional CDI beans as opposed to
            Enterprise Beans and you can use Interceptors, Jakarta Transactions,
            Jakarta Concurrency and Jakarta Security in the application layer.
            Value Objects can be implemented as either Jakarta Persistence
            embeddables or entities. In addition to Jakarta Persistence,
            Messaging, Mail and REST clients it is very likely you may use CDI
            and Bean Validation to implement infrastructure components. The
            DeltaSpike Data module is very helpful in implementing repositories.
            The point really is that Jakarta EE APIs are there to help you
            implement elegantly designed systems as needed.</p>
