                        <p class="lead">This project demonstrates how you can develop applications with the Jakarta EE platform using widely adopted
				        architectural best practices like Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The code is intended to mirror a non-trivial
				        application that developers in the real work would work on. It attempts to demonstrate first-hand how you can use
				        Jakarta EE to effectively meet practical enterprise concerns such as productivity, agility, testability, flexibility,
				        maintainability, scalability and security.<br><br>

                            The project is directly based on the well known original
		            <a target="_blank" href="http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/">Java DDD sample</a> application developed by DDD pioneer Eric Evans'
			    company <a target="_blank" href="http://domainlanguage.com/">Domain Language</a> and the Swedish software consulting company
			    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.citerus.se/">Citerus</a>. The cargo example actually comes from Eric Evans'
			    <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">seminal book</a>.
			    That project uses older versions of Spring, Hibernate and Jetty whereas we focus on vanilla Jakarta EE.<br><br>

                            In the same vein as that project, we certainly are not in the business of prescribing how you should write Jakarta EE applications.
			    The code simply demonstrates ideas that you could adopt if you think they are right for you. We have also tried to show you just
			    some of the many different approaches that you could take to interpret and implement DDD concepts. You are of course warmly
			    welcomed to provide feedback and contribute to this Open Source project.<br><br>

                            As such, we will continue to rely heavily on the original DDD sample application as well as the existing knowledge base in the DDD
			    community as invaluable resources on further details on DDD as it applies to this code base (please see the
			    <a target="_blank" href=" http://dddsample.sourceforge.net">DDD Sample pages</a> for vital details). We also highly recommend you
			    read the <a target="_blank" href="#eeddd">Jakarta EE and DDD</a> section. It is perhaps best to skim it, explore the
			    application/code and revisit the section.<br><br>

                            This effort is very grateful for the kind blessings and guidance of the good folks behind the original DDD sample application.</p>

		           You can do that
			    through the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/wiki/Getting-Started">video on
			    the Getting Started section of the
			    documentation</a> that covers most of the major functionality for Eclipse Cargo Tracker.
		            <br/><br/>
		            If you simply wish to explore the code,
			    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/archive/master.zip">download it as a zip</a> or browse
				the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/">GitHub repository</a>.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The source is a Maven project, so you should be able to easily build it or set it up in your favorite IDE.
			    We currently have instructions for <a href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/wiki/Eclipse-IDE" target="_blank">the Eclipse IDE
			    as part of our documentation</a>. We welcome contributions showing how to use the project with other IDEs.<br><br>
                            You can also run the application directly from the Maven command line using Apache Cargo. All you need to do
			    is navigate to the project source root and type the following (please make sure you have Java SE 8/Java SE 11/Java SE 17 and JAVA_HOME set up):

                            <br/><br/><code>mvn clean package cargo:run</code><br/><br/>

                            Once the application starts up, just open up a browser and navigate
			    to <a target="_blank" href="http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/">http://localhost:8080/cargo-tracker/</a>.<br/><br/>

                            The project currently runs on Jakarta EE 8, Payara 5 and Java SE 8/Java SE 11/Java SE 17. We welcome contributions for running the
			    application on other Jakarta EE implementations (as you will see in the source code, there are few
			    dependencies on Payara so this should be pretty easy to do).<br/><br/>
			    
                            Eclipse Cargo Tracker is deployed to Kubernetes on the cloud using GitHub Actions workflows. You can find the demo deployment on the Scaleforce

			    Blue Prints/PetStore was far ahead of it's time. It helped establish some degree of order out of the chaos
			    of mid-nineties enterprise development. It brought to the mainstream many architectural patterns like
			    separation of concerns, layering, MVC, DAO, DTO and the like that we now mostly take for granted. It also
			    helped catapult J2EE itself. The PetStore of course was not without its own fair share of problems. The
			    most significant of these problems is the fact that many patterns in the PetStore were either motivated or
			    encumbered by the problems of the then relatively new J2EE and EJB 2 technologies and EJB 2 entity beans
		            did not support OO well.</p>

                        <center><img src="img/cargotracker-influences.png"/></center>

                        <p class="lead">DDD provided concrete solutions to the weaknesses in the PetStore with the help of emergent
			    concepts of POJO programming, ORM and lightweight frameworks. It is no accident that DDD is now widely
			    adopted by the Spring and .NET communities. As Jakarta EE has now fully embraced concepts like POJO
			    programming, lightweight programming models, annotations, ORM, rich domain models, agility and testability,
			    this project brings things full circle. It demonstrates first hand how you can utilize the best of the
			    breed in enterprise software development practices using the power and simplicity of the standard,
			    vendor-neutral Jakartra EE platform. Notably unlike the J2EE Blue Prints/PetStore, we will not invent new
			    patterns here but simply adopt the proven, mature ideas in the DDD community.</p>

			    traditional OOAD (Object Oriented Analysis and Design) and modeling the real world problem the software is
			    trying to solve as closely as possible.</p>

                        <p class="lead"><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Wikipedia</a> does

			    <a target="_blank" href="https://dzone.com/refcardz/getting-started-domain-driven">DDD Ref Card</a>
			    on DZone is a brief read and does a great job of explaining the core concepts of DDD. For a bit more

			    itself. However, we recommend not starting with the book until you get a bit of your bearings around this
			    application first.</p>

                        <p class="lead">The basic building blocks of the domain are entities, value objects, aggregates, services,

			    section of our documentation overviews how these concepts are implemented in the application using Jakarta EE.

			    section of our documentation explains the architectural layers in the application and how they relate to
			    various Jakarta EE APIs. The DDD community also fully embraces practices like automated testing, agile,
			    emergent design, refactoring and Continuous Integration. We have incorporated all these practices into the
			    application in a pragmatic fashion. DDD is a very useful concept in pragmatic microservices development, particularly ideas such
		            as the bounded context. We have incorporated some of these ideas. Some DDD related concepts we have not tackled are CQRS and
		            Event Sourcing.</p>

                        <p class="lead">One of the primary principles of DDD is that design should be focused on the business domain,
			    not technology. The role of technology is to empower software developers to implement readable, productive,
			    maintainable systems that mirror the real world, not place constraints on design choices. Most mainstream
			    technology stacks today have matured enough to make this principle a reality, Jakarta EE is no exception. In
			    fact, with a single-minded focus on simplicity, POJOs, Java/OO centric strong typing, annotations and
			    intelligent defaults that minimize system configuration and lets developers focus on solving the business
			    problem, we think Jakarta EE is one of the best platforms to support DDD. Jakarta EE makes it possible to quickly
			    and effectively produce a working system by annotating domain and application classes and implementing
			    interface and infrastructure code. In the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/wiki/Characterization">Characterization</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/cargotracker/wiki/Layers">Layers</a>
			    sections of our documentation we have overviewed how some key Jakarta EE APIs map to DDD concepts and pointed
			    you to some of the most important bits of implementation code in the application. In the figure below, we
			    have summarized how this mapping looks like visually as a handy cross reference.</p>

                        <p class="lead">Note, the diagram above is most certainly not intended to be comprehensive. For example,
			    besides Jakarta Faces, REST, WebSocket and Batch, some other technologies that are very useful in implementing
			    interfaces are CDI (for Faces backing beans), Bean Validation, Enterprise Beans (e.g. messaging end-points),
	                    JSON Processing and JSON Binding. Similarly, you can choose to implement application services as
			    transactional CDI beans as opposed to Enterprise Beans and you can use Interceptors, Jakarta Transactions, Jakarta
			    Concurrency and Jakarta Security in the application layer. Value Objects can be implemented as either Jakarta Persistence
			    embeddables or entities. In addition to Jakarta Persistence, Messaging, Mail and REST clients it is very likely you may use
			    CDI and Bean Validation to implement infrastructure components. The DeltaSpike Data
		            module is very helpful in implementing repositories. The point really is that Jakarta EE APIs are there to help
			    you implement elegantly designed systems as needed.</p>
