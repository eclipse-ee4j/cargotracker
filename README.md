# Introduction

The Cargo Tracker project demonstrates how you can develop applications with the Java EE platform using widely adopted architectural best practices like Domain-Driven Design \(DDD\). The project is directly based on the well known original [Java DDD sample](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/) application developed by DDD pioneer Eric Evans' company [Domain Language](http://domainlanguage.com/) and the Swedish software consulting company [Citerus](http://www.citerus.se/). The cargo example actually comes from Eric Evans' [seminal book](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215). That project uses older versions of Spring, Hibernate and Jetty whereas we focus on vanilla Java EE.

* The[ Getting Started](getting-started.md) section provides brief orientation on the project.
* The [NetBeans](netbeans.md) section provides detailed instructions on how to get started with NetBeans.
* The [Java EE and DDD](java-ee-and-ddd.md) section provides a brief overview of DDD as it relates to this project and Java EE.
* The [Characterization](characterization.md) section overviews how the basic building blocks of the domain - entities, value objects, aggregates, services, repositories and factories - are implemented in the application using Java EE.
* The [Layers](layers.md) section explains the architectural layers in the application and how they relate to various Java EE APIs.
* The [Resources](resources.md) section provides some useful resources for learning more about DDD and Java EE.
